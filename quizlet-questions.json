    "correct_index": 3,
    "explanation": "Motivation is a state of readiness or eagerness to change, which fluctuates from one time to another. The role of the social worker is to create an atmosphere that is conducive to change and to increase a client's intrinsic motivation, so that change arises from within rather than being imposed from without. If a client is driven to change internally, it is much more likely that the change effort will be sustained. A technique to increase motivation is to work to remove barriers and instill hope or the belief that life can be different.",

Generally, a social worker has to believe that a client is a danger to an identifiable third party and that the client is able to act on this danger in order for it to be considered necessary to warn and/or protect the intended victim. For example, if a client states that he or she is going to kill \"women,\" a social worker may consider this client a danger to others and take appropriate action. However, there is not an obligation to notify intended victim(s) because the threat is too broad and does not require notification to women in general. In addition, if a client who is incarcerated and not going to be released makes a threat against someone outside the prison to whom he or she does not have access, there is no imminent threat.
