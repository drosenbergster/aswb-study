Commenter’s  Note:  For  those  taking  the  exams  in  the  spring  of  2025,  the  exams  have  been  switched  from  PSI  to  Pearson  VUE.  
Instead
 
of
 
taking
 
the
 
exams
 
all
 
in
 
one
 
go,
 
the
 
exam
 
will
 
be
 
split
 
into
 
two
 
sections
 
with
 
a
 
mandatory
 
10
 
minute

When
 
you
 
have
 
submitted

first
 
section
 
of
 
the

you

the
 
questions.
  
Practice  Questions   1.  Quizlet  (currently  ~668  questions)   Note:  anything  highlighted  in  gray  is  a  way  I  memorized  terms   Green  writing  are  test  tips/  concepts  that  come  up  a  lot  on  practice  questions.

NEVER  make  
assumptions/
 
fill
 
in
 
the
 
gaps.
 ●  Example  questions  from  the  practice  exam:  ○  Empty  bottles  of  alcohol  sitting  around  the  house  during  a  house  visit.  →  ask  the  client.  ○  Client  refuses  services  because  it’s  “God’s  Will”  →  explore  use  of  religion.  ○  Teacher  tells  SW  that  a  child  is  coming  to  school  with  messy  clothing  and  occasional  bruises  →  talk  to  student

●  IF  however,  we  know  clearly  that  there  is  abuse/neglect  (i.e.  parents  tell  SW  that  they  believe  alcohol  has  health  benefits  and  
they
 
allow
 
children
 
to
 
get
 
drunk)
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
need
 
for
 
further
 
assessment.
 
Only
 
assess
 
when
 
things
 
are
 
ominous
 
or
 
the
 
SW
 
has
 
not
 
had
 
direct
 
conversation
 
with
 
the
 
client.

●  Parents  allude  to  supporting  physical  punishment …   We  want  to  clarify  the  client’s  basic  understanding  of  physical  punishment  practices  before  taking  any  further  action.   ●  Caretaker  describes  yelling  at  their  parents  who  are  in  a  wheelchair …  clarify  the  extent  of  the  yelling.

 ●  In  Vivo  Desensitization :  pairing  &  moving  through  hierarchy  of  anxiety  (least  to  most  anxiety-provoking  situations);  takes  
place
 
in
 
“real”
 
life.
 ●  Systematic  Desensitization :  anxiety-producing  stimulus  is  paired  with  relaxation-producing  response  so  that  eventually  an  
anxiety-producing
 
stimulus
 
produces
 
a
 
relaxation
 
response.

behavior  occurs  ○  Negative  Reinforcement:  Method  of  encouraging  desired  behaviors  by  removing  an  aversive  (unpleasant)  stimulus  ●  Punishment :  decreases  behavior   ○  Positive  Punishment:  Adding  an  aversive  stimulus  following  an  unwanted  behavior  to  decrease  the  likelihood  of  that  
behavior
 
occurring
 
again.
 ○  Negative  Punishment:  Removing  a  desirable  stimulus  (like  a  privilege  or  reward)  following  a  behavior,  leading  to  a

 Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy   Goal  is  to  change  patterns  of  thinking  or  behavior  that  are  responsible  for  clients’  difficulties   ●  Rational  Emotive  Therapy  (RET):  argument,  persuasion,  and  rational  reevaluation  to  change  self-defeating  beliefs  ●  Cognitive  Restructuring :  identifying  dysfunctional  beliefs  and  patterns  of  thought;  rewarding  success  ●  Partializing  Techniques :  Breaking  down  complex  issues  into  simpler  ones  to  make  it  less  overwhelming,*use  Hierarchy  of  
needs
 
 ○  Example  from  test  question:  SW  meets  with  an  adolescent  client  who  wants  to  run  away  from  home.  They  give  
several
 
reasons
 
for
 
this
 
desire.
 
The
 
best
 
technique
 
for
 
the
 
SW
 
to
 
use
 
is

Structural  Analyzes  the  family  structure  based  on  family  relationships,  behaviors,  and  patterns  during  therapy  ●  Genogram :  (Geno  =  genetics)  composition  and  structure  of  one's  family  –  genetics  ●  Ecomap :  personal  and  family  social  relationships.  ●  Entropy:  Disorder  ●  Homeostasis:  steady  state  Differentiation :  Becoming  specialized  in  structure  and  function  ●  Negative  feedback  loops  patterns  of  interaction  that  maintain  stability  or  constancy  while  minimizing  change.  Help  to  maintain  homeostasis.   ●  Positive  feedback  loops  patterns  of  interaction  that  facilitate  change  or  movement  toward  either  growth  or  dissolution.  ●  Equifinality :  ability  of  the  family  system  to  accomplish  the  same  goals  through  different  routes.  
Bowenian  /  Family  Systems  
Intergenerational  influences  on  family  and  individual  behavior  ●  Differentiation :  core  concept!!,   the  more  differentiated,  the  more  client  can  be  an  individual  while  in  emotional  contact  with  family  ●  Emotional  Fusion :  tendency  for  family  members  to  share  an  emotional  response  ●  Emotional  Triangle:  network  of  relationships  among  three  people  NOTE:  in  the  case  of  domestic  abuse,  social  workers  should  not  utilize  couples/family  therapy    Group  Work  Role  Modeling  Live  Modeling:  watching  a  real  person  perform  the  desired  behavior  Symbolic  Modeling:  filmed  or  videotaped  models  demonstrating  desired  behavior  Participant  Modeling:  individual  models  anxiety-evoking  behaviors  for  a  client  &  then  prompts  the  client  to  engage  in  the  behavior  Covert  Modeling:  clients  are  asked  to  use  their  imagination,  visualizing  a  particular  behavior

Group  Work  Cooperative  learning  enhances  the  total  output.   ●  When  individual  problems  arise,  they  should  be  directed  to  the  group  for  possible  solutions-  the  group  is  the  agent  of  change.  ●   Confidentiality  cannot  be  guaranteed    
Psychodrama   roles  are  enacted  in  a  group  context.  Group  members  recreate  their  problems  and  examine  each  other's  role  dilemmas.  Groupthink:  The  tendency  to  make  faulty  decisions  based  on  group  pressures;  ignore  alternatives,  and  take  irrational  actions  that  dehumanize  others  ●  illusion  of  invulnerability,  collective  rationalization,  belief  in  inherent  morality,  stereotyped  views  of  those  “on  the  out”,  direct  pressure  on  dissenters,  self-censorship,  illusion  of  unanimity,  self-appointed  “mindguards”  ●  Folie  à  deux :  shared  delusion  Group  Polarization:  decision  making;  discussion  strengthens  a  dominant  POV;  shift  to  a  more  extreme  position   Open  Group:  new  members  can  join  at  any  time  -  Example:  AA  NOTE:  AA  also  views  alcoholism  as  a  disease    Closed  Group:  all  members  begin  at  the  same  time  Types  of  groups:  counseling,  activity,  action,  self  help,  natural,  structured,  unstructured,  crisis,  reference  (aka  similar  values)  Action  groups  
Stages  of  Group  Development  1.  Preaffiliation :  development  of  trust  (forming)  2.  Power  &  Control :  struggles  for  individual  autonomy  &  group  identification  (storming)  3.  Intimacy :  utilizing  self  in  service  of  the  group  (norming)  4.  Differentiation :  acceptance  of  each  other  as  distinct  individuals  (performing)  5.  Separation/Termination  (adjourning)(like,  “this  meeting  is  adjourned!-The  purpose  of  the  meeting  has  been  met!)  Beginning:  SW  identifies  purpose  of  the  group  and  SW’s  role;  time  to  convene,  organize,  &  set  plan;  members  often  remain  different/removed  until  they  develop  relationships,  always  discussing  termination  from  the  first  session!   Middle:  almost  all  the  group’s  work  occurs  here;  relationships  strengthened;  group  leaders  less  involved  End:  group  reviews  its  accomplishments

In  an  adult  psychiatric  setting,  one  would  expect  a  wide  range  of  diagnoses,  family  statuses,  levels  of  functioning  and  intellectual  capacities.  Of  those,  the  MOST  important  for  successful  group  functioning  is  the  participants'  level  of  functioning   Self  disclosure  in  group  treatment  contradicts  behavioral  expectations  of  prison  culture.  Part  VI:  The  Intervention  Process  Phases  of  Intervention/Problem-Solving  Process  ●  Engagement,  Assessment,  Planning,  Treatment/Intervention,  Evaluation,  Termination Stages  of  Change  Always  aim  to  use  a  strengths  based  perspective.   ●  Precontemplation:  client  unaware,  unable,  and/or  unwilling  to  change;  arguing,  interrupting,  denial,  or  ignoring  the  problem;  
may
 
not
 
attend
 
appointments,
 
not
 
agree
 
to
 
change;
 
denial,
 
ignorance
 
of
 
problem
 
–
 
SW
 
should
 
establish
 
rapport,
 
acknowledge
 
resistance,
 
keep
 
conversations
 
informal,
 
engage
 
clients,
 
and
 
acknowledge
 
their
 
feelings,
 
concerns,
 
etc.
 ●  Contemplation:  client  is  ambivalent  or  uncertain  regarding  behavior  change;  due  to  this,  their  behaviors  are  unpredictable;  
client
 
may
 
be
 
willing
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
pros
 
and
 
cons
 
of
 
behavior
 
change,
 
but
 
is
 
not
 
committed
 
to
 
working
 
towards
 
it;
 
ambivalence,
 
conflicted
 
emotion
 ●  Preparation:  experimenting  with  small  changes,  collecting  information  about  change  ●  Action,  Maintenance,  Relapse   can  lead  to  feelings  of  frustration  and  failure  Verbal  &  Nonverbal  Communication  ●  Always  respond  empathetically  to  a  client’s  concerns   ●  Reflection:  acknowledging  clients  feelings  ●  Exploring  SILENCE:  being  attentive  and  remaining  silent,  especially  when  the  client  is  silent.  ●  Partilization:  breaking  up  problems  into  small,  more  feasible  parts.  ●  Clarification:  asking  the  client  questions  to  understand  what  they  are  saying  ●  Confrontation:  challenged  an  established  client  to  think  about  maladaptive  behaviors.  Can  be  used  with  clients  with  
addictions,
 
perpetrator,
 
and/or
 
are
 
resistant
 
to
 
treatment
 
–
 
especially
 
ego-syntonic
 
disorders
 
such
 
as
 
anorexia.
 ●  Active  Listening:  commenting  on  clients’  statements,  open-ended  questions,  etc.   ○  Interpretation :  pulling  together  patterns  of  behavior  to  get  a  new  understanding  ○  Reframing/Relabeling:  stating  problem  in  a  different  way  so  a  client  can  see  possible  solutions  ○  Universalization:  the  generalization  or  normalization  of  behavior.  
  

 16  
Defense  Mechanisms  ●  Projection:  My  internal  negative  beliefs  are  thrown  on  you.  e.g.   a  cheating  spouse  who  suspects  their  partner  is  being  
unfaithful.
 ○  Opposite  is  Introjection:  internalizes  the  ideas  or  voices  of  other  people.  e.g.  A  teacher  scolds  the  classroom  for  not  
doing
 
the
 
work
 
properly
 
and
 
Beth
 
assumes
 
they're
 
talking
 
primarily
 
to
 
her.

 ●  Projective  Identification:  Borderline  Personality  Disorder;  unconsciously  perceiving  others’  behavior  as  a  reflection  of  identity  ○  PI  can  be  a  sign  of  borderline   personality  organization,  but  PI  can  happen  to  anyone  ○  Projection  of  life  experiences  of  person  X  onto  person  Y;  person  Y  identifies  with  the  projection  and  begins  to  act  in  
manner
 
aligned
 
with
 
the
 
projection
 ○   ●  Displacement:  Anger/negative  beliefs  about  a  situation/person  are  acted  out  on  another,  lesser/more  vulnerable  
person/thing.
 
e.g.
 
Amanda
 
was
 
angry
 
at
 
her
 
boss
 
for
 
adding
 
more
 
to
 
her
 
workload,
 
but
 
kept
 
her
 
composure.
 
Later
 
that
 
evening,
 
Amanda
 
shouts
 
at
 
her
 
husband
 
at
 
minor
 
inconveniences.
 
 ●  Sublimation:  potentially  maladaptive  feelings  or  behaviors  are  diverted  into  socially  acceptable,  adaptive  channels  e.g.  
person
 
with
 
angry
 
feelings
 
channels
 
them
 
into
 
athletics
 ●  Reaction  Formation:  acting  opposite  (in  affect,  ideas,  attitudes,  or  behaviors)  e.g.  In  therapy,  Mark  states  that  his  brother  is  a  
selfish
 
man
 
who
 
angers
 
him
 
constantly.
 
Later
 
in
 
the
 
session,
 
the
 
therapist
 
hears
 
that
 
Mark
 
recently
 
bought
 
his
 
brother
 
a
 
new
 
shirt
 
as
 
a
 
gift
 
and
 
is
 
planning
 
on
 
going
 
over
 
for
 
dinner
 
that
 
night.
 
 ●  Compensation:  enables  one  to  make  up  for  real  or  fancied  deficiencies  e.g.  a  short  man  embarrassed  by  his  height  becomes  
an
 
aggressive,
 
“manly
 
man.”
 
 ●  Undoing:  Symbolically  negating  or  reversing  unacceptable  thoughts,  feelings,  or  actions  with  words  or  actions.   ●  Identification:  an  individual,  to  varying  degrees,  makes  himself  or  herself  like  someone  else;   “Identification  with  the  
aggressor”
 
is
 
very
 
common.
 
e.g.
 
A
 
son
 
who
 
was
 
abused
 
by
 
his
 
father
 
is
 
a
 
known
 
bully
 
at
 
his
 
school.
 
 ●  Decompensation:  deterioration  of  existing  defenses  ●  Devaluation:  BPD ;  person  attributes  exaggerated  negative  qualities  to  self  or  another   ●  Splitting;  BPD;  polarized  views  of  self  and  others  arise  due  to  intolerable  conflicting  emotions.  “All  bad”  or  “all  good.”  ●  Intellectualization:  avoids  emotions  by  focusing  on  facts  &  logic ●  Some  other  defense  mechanisms  include:  Repression,  Denial,  Dissociation   
  

 17  
Part  VII:  DSM-5  and  Medication   ●  The  DSM-5  replaced  the  Not  Otherwise  Specified  (NOS)  categories  with  two  options  ○  Other  Specified  Disorder :  specify  the  reason  that  the  criteria  for  a  specific  disorder  are  not  met   ○  Unspecified  Disorder :  option  to  forgo  specification.  Terms  to  Know  ●  WHODAS  2.0:  DSM  assessment  to  help  SW  determine  assistance  needed  in  functional  life  domains.   ●  Biopsychosocial  Assessments  ●  Mental  Status  Exam:  quick  assessment  of  current  functioning,  usually  based  on:  appearance,  orientation  (awareness  of  
time/place,
 
etc.),
 
speech
 
pattern,
 
affect/mood,
 
impulsive/potential
 
for
 
harm,

*  Malingering :  condition  associated  with  this  DO,  fakes  an  illness  for  physical  gain  or  purpose.  I.e.  faking  an  illness  or  an  injury  to  collect  disability  pay.  Malingering  is  not  a  mental  disorder!   
Oppositional  Defiant  Disorder   
 Patterns  of  anger,  irritability,  argumentative  or  defiant  behavior,  and/or  vindictiveness.  Issues  are  rooted  in  the  need  for  control.   Unlike  children  with  Conduct  DO,  children  with  ODD  are  not  aggressive  toward  people  or  animals,  do  not  destroy  property,  and  do  not  show  a  pattern  of  theft  or  deceit.   
Conduct  Disorder    Repetitive  &  persistent  pattern  of  behavior  in  which  the  basic  rights  of  others,  or  major  age-appropriate  norms,  are  violated.  Issues  are  rooted  in  the  need  for  control.   ●  often  seen  as  the  precursor  to  antisocial  personality  disorder ,  which  is  not  diagnosed  until  the  individual  is  18  years  old  
Neurocognitive  Disorder  aka   Organic  Brain  Syndrome   
 Decrease  functioning  of  the  brain,  nervous  system,  or  biologically  based,  and  thus  impacts  daily  functioning  aka  IADLS  and  ADLS  (Instrumental  activities  of  daily  living  and  activities  of  daily  living).  Examples:  Alzheimer's,  traumatic  brain  injury,  HIV,  parkinsons,  medical  condition.     Symptoms:   ●  Physical  pain,  muscle  malfunction  (weakness,  tremors,  etc.),  change  in  sensation  (tingling,  hypersensitivity  to  light,  etc.),  consciousness  (fainting,  confusion,  etc.)  and  senses   Cognitive  Disorder  Terminology  (I  don't  see  this  often  on  practice  questions)  ○  Dysarthria :  Slurred  speech   i.  “D”  for  drunk-  slur  your  words  when  drunk  ○  Aphasia :  Difficulty  understanding  language  or  using  language  to  speak  or  write  ○  Prosopagnosia :  Inability  to  recognize  familiar  faces  i.   P  for  person/portrait  ○  Agnosia :   Inability  to  recognize  familiar  objects   i.  “NOSIA”  sounds  like  nose  when  something  is  so  close  to  knowing  but  you  fail  to  notice,  we  say  “it  was  right  under  my  nose”  ○  Acalculia :  Inability  to  do  simple  arithmetic  
  

 22  
i.   “calc”   Note  for  Geriatric  Population :  A  correct  diagnosis  is  essential  to  effective  treatment,  but  this  is  particularly  challenging  for  elderly  clients  who  are  often  affected  by  medical  comorbidities.  Elderly  clients  are  at  high  risk  for  depression  and  chronic  (e.g.  dementia)  or  acute  (e.g.  delerium)  cognitive  disorders;  Some  patients  have  both  affective  (mood)  and  cognitive  disorders.   
Delirium  (a  type  of  Organic  Brain  Syndrome)  
 1  or  more  persistent  delusions  without  other  psychotic  symptoms;  Disorientation;  Primarily  short  term   
Korsakoff’s  Syndrome    Short  term  memory  loss  and  other  cognitive  related  symptoms  with  chronic  alcohol  use.   
Substance  Abuse/  Dependency  
 Possible  Signs  of  Drug  Use  ●  Cannabis :  glassy,  red  eyes;  loud  talking;  inappropriate  laughter  followed  by  sleepiness;  loss  of  interest,  motivation;  weight  gain  or  loss   ●  Cocaine :  dilated  pupils;  hyperactivity;  euphoria;  irritability;  anxiety;  excessive  talking  followed  by  depression  or  excessive  sleeping  at  odd  times;  may  go  long  periods  of  time  without  eating  or  sleeping;  weight  loss;  dry  mouth  and  nose  ○  Withdrawal :  depression,  vomiting,  fatigue   ●  Heroin :  contracted  pupils;  no  response  of  pupils  to  light;  needle  marks;  sleeping  at  unusual  times;  sweating;  vomiting;  coughing,  sniffling;  twitching;  loss  of  appetite  ○  Withdrawal:  muscle  spasm,  restlessness,  bone  pain  Diagnostic  Criteria  for  Personality  Disorders  Develop  and  are  present  during  early  childhood-  many  times  as  a  result  of  trauma.   Disorder  Traits   
Schizoid  (CLUSTER  A:  Odd,  eccentric))  
Introverted,  withdrawn,  fearful  of  closeness/intimacy  with  others   “Schizoid”  rhymes  with  “avoid”  →  these  people  avoid  and  are  fearful  of  relationships   
Schizotypal  (CLUSTER  A:  Odd,  eccentric))  
Odd,  strange,  outlandish,  or  paranoid  beliefs,  "magical  thinking"  
  

 23  
Schizo typ al,  sounds  like  “type”  –  these  are  the  people  who  would  be  known  to  go  on  reddit/youtube  and  “type”  up  their  conspiracy  theories  for  everyone  to  see   
Paranoid  (CLUSTER  A:  Odd,  eccentric))  
Extreme  suspiciousness  or  mistrust  of  others  
Antisocial  (CLUSTER  B:  Dramatic,  emotional,  erratic)  
Amorality  and  lack  of  affect;  after  age  18  
Borderline  (CLUSTER  B:  Dramatic,  emotional,  erratic)   
Unstable  interpersonal  relationships,  behavior,  mood,  &  self-image;  abrupt  and  extreme  mood  changes;  fluctuating  self-image  
Histrionic  (CLUSTER  B:  Dramatic,  emotional,  erratic)  
“Drama  queen”  excessive  emotionality  (“hysterical”),  attention  seeking,  seeks  praise  and  approva l  (on  exam,  usually  seen  as  a  woman)  
Narcissistic  (CLUSTER  B:  Dramatic,  emotional,  erratic)  
grandiose  sense  of  self  importance,  fantasies  of  unlimited  success,  entitlement,  exploiting  others,  lack  empathy   (on  the  exam,  usually  seen  as  a  man)  
Avoidant  (CLUSTER  C:  Anxious,  fearful)

Submissive  behavior;  reliance  on  others  for  personal  decisions;  need  for  excessive  reassurance  and  advice  
Obsessive-Compulsive  (OCPD)  (CLUSTER  C:  Anxious,  fearful)  
Difference  from  OCD:  OCPD  not  directed  by  thoughts  one  is  unable  to  control;  OCD  is  distressed  by  behaviors,  whereas  OCPD  thinks  their  actions  have  aim/purpose-  don’t  think  it’s  irrational,  so  usually  won’t  seek  help

 Medications  While  there  are  many  medications  that  can  be  used,  these  are  by  far  the  most  important  ones  to  know  –  I  don’t  recommend  wasting

  Part  VIII:  Organizational  Theories   1.  Primary  intervention :  a  program  that  seeks  to  stop  problems  before  they  start.  2.  Secondary  intervention :  locating  an  at-risk  group  and  providing  them  services  before  they  become  involved  in  trouble.   a.

consultants)
 ●  Internal  Control:  the  establishment  of  standardized  policies/procedures  relating  to  all  transactions  &  events  involving  
monetary
 
items
 
 ●  Recording/Reporting:  use  of  a  system  to  list  &  classify  all  transactions  of  a  fiscal  nature  ●  Evaluating:  periodic  review  of  financial  activities  to  assess  their  efficiency  &  effectiveness  Program  Evaluation  ●  Cost-Benefit  Analysis:  determines  the  financial  costs  of  operating  a  program  as  compared  with  the  fiscal  benefits  of  its  
outcomes
 ●  Cost-Effectiveness  Analysis:  similar  to  Cost-Benefit  Analysis,  but  considers  the  benefits  that  are  not  measured  in  monetary  
terms,
 
such
 
as
 
illnesses
 
prevented

neutral
 
stance
 Ex:  if  clients  are  consistently  not  keeping  apts  in  an  agency,  forming  a  committee  of  clients  and  staff  to

 Location  Specific  Responsibilities   ●  During  Crisis:  Goal  is  to  return  to  previous  state  of  functioning  ○  ALWAYS  focus  on  immediate  safety  before  any  legal  action.  ■  Young  girl  comes  to  SW  because  her  25  year  old  boyfriend  is  threatening  to  harm  her …  FIRST  seek  shelter,  
ensure
 
safety,
 
THEN
 
contact
 
proper
 
authorities
 
 ○  Steps:  (1)  Assess  lethality  (2)  Establish  rapport  (3)  Identify  problems  (4)  Deal  with  feelings  (5)  Explore  alternatives  (6)  
Develop
 
an
 
action

(7)
 
Follow-up
 ○  Always  seek  shelter  FIRST  regardless  of  the  crisis.   ●  Role  in  School  Settings:  **  SWs  DO  NOT  administer  testing  for  special  ed  or  disability  diagnosis.  This  is  done  by  a  
psychologist.
 
 ○  Collateral  information  from  teachers,  school  staff,  or  parents,  may  be  needed  for  information  pertaining  to  the  
presenting
 
problem.
 
Collaboration
 
with
 
teachers
 
if
 
often
 
needed.
 
 ○  Interview  any  student  that  you  suspect  of  abuse.   ●  CPS  Worker  (Child  Welfare):  Investigate  and  assess  safety/severity  in  abuse  and  neglect  cases,  aim  for  family  preservation,  
usually

 ●  Inpatient/Psychiatric  Treatment  SW:  Risk  assessment  is  CRUCIAL,  Never  discharge  patient  if  they  have  active  
suicidal/homocidal
 
ideation
 ○  Use  of  Empathy  in  Assessment/Therapy:  trying  to  understand  a  client’s  perspective  while  maintaining  the  perspective  
of
 
an
 
outside
 
observer
  
 ●  Hospital  SW:  Primarily  focuses  on  case  management  and  safe  discharge  back  into  the  community  ○  In  the  case  of  noncompliant  individuals  who  believe  in  God's  will  and  refuse  services:   explore  the  role  that  religion  
plays
 
in
 
the
 
clients
 
overall
 
self
 
care.
 
The
 
SW
 
should

 Part  XI:  Research   Types  of  Research  ●  Qualitative  research:  collecting  information  through  unstructured  interviews,  observation,  and/or  focus  groups  ●  Quantitative  research :  collects  data  through  input  of  responses  to  research  instruments  containing  questions  (such  as  
questionnaires);
 
information
 
can
 
be
 
input
 
either
 
by
 
respondents
 
themselves
 
(online
 
or
 
mail
 
survey)
 
or
 
social
 
workers
 
can
 
input
 
data
 
(ex.
 
phone
 
surveys
 
or
 
interviews) Types  of  Experimental  Designs   ●  Experimental  ●  Pre-experimental :  Contain  intervention  groups  only  and  lack  comparison/control  groups,  making  them  the  weakest.  ●  Quasi-experimental:  assignment  of  participants  to  an  experimental/control  group  cannot  be  made  at  random  for  either  
practical
 
or
 
ethical
 
reasons; this  is  usually  the  case  in  field  research. Assignment  of  participants  to  conditions  is  usually  based  
on
 
self-selection
 
(e.g.
 
employees
 
who
 
have
 
chosen
 
to
 
work
 
at
 
a
 
particular
 
place)
 
or
 
selection
 
by
 
an
 
administrator

children
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
attend
 
behavioral
 
therapy
 
due
 
to

school
 
behaviors)
 
 
 ○  Single  Subject  Design :  Aims  to  determine  whether  an  intervention  has  the  intended  impact  on  a  client,  or  on  many  
clients
 
who

validity
 
(individual)
 ■  A  =  baseline  |  B  =  intervention   ■  Pre-  and  post-test  or  single-case  study  (AB)  denotes  a  comparison  of  behavior  before  treatment  ■  Reversal  or  multiple  baseline  (ABA  or  ABAB)   Single  subject  designs  are  most  practical  for  private  services.  Quasi  experiments  are  most  practical  for  agency  program

Reliability  and  Validity   ●  both  about  how  well  a  method  measures  something:   ●  Reliability  refers  to  the  consistency  of  a  measure  (whether  the  results  can  be  reproduced  under  the  same  conditions).   ●  Validity  refers  to  the  accuracy  of  a  measure  (whether  the  results  really  do  represent  what  they  are  supposed  to  measure).  ○  Therefore  testing  the  study’s  ability  to  be  generalized   internally  (is  the  actual  study  free  from  flaws?)  and  externally  
(can
 
the
 
test
 
be
 
generalized
 
for
 
real
 
life?).
  Types  of  Validity  Definition  Subcategories   Example  
Criterion  Related  Validity   
How  well  a  test  correlates  with  an  established  standard  of  comparison   how  well  one  measure  predicts  an  outcome  for  another  measure.   
1.  Predictive  Validity:   extent  to  which  a  survey  measure  forecasts  future  performance.  2.  Concurrent  Validity:  how  well  a  new  test  compares  to  an  well-established  test.  They  should  result  in  similar  findings  if  it  is  valid.  3.  Retrospective  Validity.  the  extent  to  which  an  instrument  that  claims  to  measure  a  particular  behavior  can  be  shown  to  correlate  with  past  occurrences  that  demonstrate  this  behavior.   
If  a  measure  of  criminal  behavior  is  valid,  then  it  should  be  possible  to  use  it  to  predict  whether  an  individual  (a)  will  be  arrested  in  the  future  for  a  criminal  violation,  (b)  is  currently  breaking  the  law,  and  (c)  has  a  previous  criminal  record.   How  well  do  SAT  scores  predict  a  college  student’s  GPA?   
Construct  Validity   The  degree  to  which  a  test  or  instrument  is  capable  of  measuring  a  concept,  trait,  or  other  theoretical  entity.    
1.  Convergent:  the  extent  to  which  responses  on  a  test  or  instrument  exhibit  a  strong  relationship  with  responses  on  conceptually  similar  tests  or  instruments.  2.  Discriminant  validity  assesses  the  degree  to  which  constructs  are  
 if  a  researcher  develops  a  new  questionnaire  to  evaluate  respondents’  levels  of  aggression,  the  construct  validity  of  the  instrument  would  be  the  extent  to  which  it  actually  assesses  aggression  as  opposed  to

different  from  (diverge  away  from)  other  constructs  to  which  they  should  be  dissimilar.  
assertiveness,  social  dominance,  and  so  forth  
Content/Face  Validity  The  extent  to  which  a  test  measures  a  representative  sample  of  the  subject  matter  or  behavior  under  investigation.   Did  the  test  consider  all  relevant  content  domains?  
  
Data  Collection  and  Analysis  Methods  ●  Secondary  Data :  information  that  has  already  been  collected  for  other  purposes  that  can  be  used  in  an  experiment   ●  Inferential  statistics:  allow  you  to  test  a  hypothesis  or  assess  whether  your  data  is  generalizable  to  the  broader  population.  ●  Descriptive  statistics :  what  does  the  data  show,  used  to  describe  the  basic  features  of  the  data.  They  provide  simple  
summaries
 
about
 
the
 
sample
 
and
 
the
 
measures.
  
summarize
 
the
 
characteristics
 
of
 
a
 
data
 
set.
 
 ●  Inferential  statistics:  answer  research  questions  or  test  models  or  hypotheses,  usually  extend  beyond  the  immediate  data.   ○  For  instance,  inferential  statistics  determine  the  probability  that  an  observed  difference  between  groups  is  a  
dependable
 
one
 
or
 
one
 
that
 
might
 
have
 
happened
 
by
 
chance.
 ●  Data  Triangulation:  used  in  assessment  to  compare  and  verify  information  from  multiple  sources.   Unit  XII:   Ethics  The  Code  of  Ethics   ●  Core  Social  Work  Values   a.  Service  b.  Social  Justice  c.  Dignity  &  Worth  of  the  Person  d.  Importance  of  Human  Relationships  e.  Integrity  f.  Competence

●  Documentation  Ethics  ○  Should  be  completed  as  soon  as  possible  after  client  contact   ○  Demographic  info,  intakes,  assessments,  quarterly  reviews,  reassessments,  service  plans  with  goals,  discharge  plan,  
release
 
of
 
info
 
&
 
referrals,
 
and
 
correspondence
 
should
 
all
 
be
 
kept
 
in
 separate  sections  or  folders  ■  Can  be  hard  copy  or  digital  ○  In  the  event  of  a  client’s  death,  these  practices  must  still  be  upheld.  Deceased  patients  have  the  same  rights  as  
living.
 ●  In  Therapy/  Client  Ethics    ○  The  SW  FIRST  task  with  any  client  is  to  establish  rapport  ○  Keep  clients'  best  interest  in  mind,  respect  self  determination  (unless  psychotic!)  ○  Arrange  for  ongoing  coverage  of  clients  if  there  is  a  reason  for  ending  therapy.   ○  Prior  to  disclosing  any  information  about  themselves,  social  workers  should  engage  in  consultation  or  supervision  
about
 
why
 
such
 
disclosure
 
is
 
being
 
considered
 
and
 
why
 
it
 
is
 
professionally
 
justified
 
in
 
this
 
instance.
 
 ○  If  client  is  a  minor  or  lacks  capacity,  informed  consent  must  be  obtained  by  a  responsible  third  party  &  assent  must  be  
obtained
 
from
 
client
 
 ○  Self-Disclosure :  prior  to  engaging  in  any  self-disclosure,  SW  should  consult  with  the  supervisor  about  why  such  
disclosure
 
is
 
professionally
 
justified.
 
Self
 
disclosure
 
is
 
considered
 
the
 
last
 
resort
 
by
 
NASW.
 ○  Avoid  conflicts  of  interests  and  dual  relationships  –  do  not  provide  therapy  to  two  or  more  people  who  have  
relationships.If
 
you
 
are
 
a
 
family
 
or
 
couple’s
 
therapist,
 
NEVER
 
see
 
the
 
individuals
 
separately.
 ○  Bartering  is  not  allowed  unless  it  is  common  practice  within  the  community  (rarely  on  exam)   ○  Ensure  continuity  of  services  ○  Provide  clients  with  reasonable  access  to  their  records  –  first  explore/discuss  the  reason  for  the  record  request,  follow   
state’s
 
laws/jurisdictions.

there
 
is
 
anything
 
that
 
could

 ○  Duty  to  warn  if  client  threatens  violence  towards  others.  NOTE:  No  duty  to  warn  for  HIV  clients.  But  do  encourage  
clients
 
to
 
discuss
 
with
 
partners.
 
 ●  Court  Ethics  ○  Subpoena :  Legal  document  that  commands  a  person  or  entity  to  testify  as  a  witness  at  a  specified  time  and  place.  
Sometimes
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
by
 
a
 
lawyer,
 
sometimes
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
by
 
a
 
judge.
 i.  Discuss  the  subpoena  with  the  agency’s  counsel  if  in  an  agency.  ○  Court  Order:  official  proclamation  by  a  judge,  if  disclosure  would  cause  harm  to  client.  i.  When  a  court  order  is  received  to  disclose  records,  supervision  should  be  obtained  first    
  

 33  
1.  Were  you  subpoenaed  by  a  judge?  →  turn  over  records   ●  SW  should  still  request  that  the  court  withdraw  the  order  or  limit  the  order  as  narrowly  as  possible  or  maintain  
the
 
records
 
under
 
seal
 
and
 
make
 
documents
 
unavailable
 
for
 
public
 
inspection.
 ●  If  SW  turns  over  records,  discuss  with  the  client.   ●  Answer  may   look  like:   “  SW  responds  to  court  order  requesting  to  withdraw  the  order  and  communicates  
with
 
client
 
for
 
release
 
of
 
information.”
  
and
 
“SW
 
turns
 
over
 
documents
 
to
 
a
 
judge
 
and
 
consults
 
with
 
clients
 
about
 
their
 
duty
 
to
 
do
 
so.”
 2.   Were  you  subpoenaed  by  a  lawyer?  →  claim  privilege  and  do  not  turn  over  documents  unless  there  is  written  
consent.
 3.  Were  you  sued  by  a  previous  client?  →  turn  over  records   ●   SW  has  the  right  to  defend  themselves  &  may  need  to  release  client  info  as  part  of  their  defense;  however,  it  
should
 
be
 
limited
 
only
 
to
 
what
 
is
 
relevant
 
to
 
defense.
 
  Solving  an  Ethical  Dilemma   1.  DETERMINE  whether  there  is  an  ethical  issue  or  dilemma  2.  IDENTIFY  the  main  principles  &  values  involved  3.  RANK  the  main  principles  &  values  that  are  most  relevant  to  the  issue  or  dilemma  4.  DEVELOP  an  action  plan  5.  IMPLEMENT  the  action  plan  6.  REFLECT  on  the  outcome  Part  XIII:   Supervision  ●  When  SW  approaches  a  colleague  in  the  community  for  structured  advice,  this  is  consultation .  Consultation  is  about  advice  
that
 
can
 
be
 
rejected
 
by
 
the
 
consultee.
 
Supervision
 
is
 
about
 
direction
 
and
 
education
 
of
 
a
 
supervisee
 
that

Types  Of  Supervision  
Benefits  Challenges   
  

 34  
Educational    
●  establishes  a  learning  alliance  between  a  supervisor  and  a  SW  with  the  aim  of  teaching  new  skills  or  refining  existing  ones  ●  SW  learns  new  skills  and  refines  existing  one  around  assessment,  intervention,  and  treatment  ●  Increases  self-awareness   ●  Assists  in  dealing  with  ethical  issues  and  (counter)transference   ●  I  remember  countertransference  and  transference  by  remembering  that  the  first  letter  indicates  who  is  on  the  receiving  end … .   ○  C  in  countertransference  is  you  to  C lient   ○  T   in  transference  is  client  to  T herapist   
 
Administrative   ●  Helps  understand  agency  policies,  the  demands  of  the  job,  and  how  to  successfully  function  within  specific  role  ●  ensures  that  SW  is  accountable  to  the  public  as  well  as  to  their  organization’s  policies;  make  sure  work  is  performed  in  an  acceptable  manner  
n/a   
Supportive   ●  Focused  on  increasing  performance  by  decreasing  job-related  stress  that  interferes  with  functioning  ●  Supportive  activities  include  activities  to  help  the  supervisee  manage  work-related  stress  that  could  interfere  with  their  ability  to  successfully  perform  their  job.  This  includes  helping  the  social  worker  manage  emotionally  challenging  environments  and  vicarious  trauma,  all  while  working  on  developing  their  emerging  professional  identity  as  a  social  worker.  
n/a  
Individual  Full  attention  and  time  given  to  the  supervisee.  ●  Safer  environment  in  which  to  explore  the  supervisor's  dynamics  &  the  impact  of  work  (countertransference,  secondary  trauma,  etc.)  ●  Less  exposure  to  poor  practices  of  peers  
Costly/time  consuming  Supervisee  may  feel  intimidated  by  supervisor  ●  no  input  from  others   
  

 35  
Peer  Group  Peer  support :  Each  group  member  can  offer/receive  wisdom  and  experience   ●  Avoids  chance  of  getting  stuck  with  unwanted  supervisor  
Time  Limited   Requires  mutual  trust,  openness  &  respect  Competition,  defensiveness,  &  criticism  may  occurs  ●  Potential  for  more  experienced/  skilled  members  to  take  supervisor  role  
Facilitated  Group  (facilitated  by  professional  leaders)   
Learning  occurs  from  others’  practice  examples  ●  opportunities  for  role  play  ●  Less  expensive  &  time  consuming  
Less  time  for  each  supervisee  Supervisor  may  be  anxious  about  their  own  competence  ●  Group  needs  to  have  high  level  of  trust
